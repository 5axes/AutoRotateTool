# Auto Rotate Tool

Plugin Rotate Tool to get the automatic rotation on Right Clic 

The Auto Rotate Tool plugin is a copy of the [CuraOrientationPlugin ](https://github.com/5axes/CuraOrientationPlugin). However, it allows to add an access to the orientation functions from keyboard shortcuts and a contextual menu.

Short-cut :

	- Calculate fast optimal printing orientation : Ctrl+Alt+R
	- Calculate extended optimal printing orientation: Ctrl+Shift+R       
	- Rotate main direction (X): Ctrl+Alt+Y

The orientation plugin is a simple wrapper around the excellent STL-Tweaker by Christoph Schranz. It allows you to quickly calculate and apply the best printable orientation directly from Cura.
